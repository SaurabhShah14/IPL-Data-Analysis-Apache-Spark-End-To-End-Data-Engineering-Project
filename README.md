IPL Data Analysis | Apache Spark End-To-End Data Engineering Project
Hello LinkedIn community! ðŸ‘‹,
I am excited to add Databricks ðŸ“Š and the basics of Apache Spark ðŸš€ to my skills panel for growth in my data career. 

âœ…I extracted IPL data from a public S3 bucket by creating my own schema using StructType and StructField.
âœ…Transformed it using Apache Spark code, and added some new columns. 
âœ…I then wrote SQL queries for analysis and visualized the results using Matplotlib ðŸ“Š and Seaborn Python libraries .
These skills will be crucial for my growth in the data field and will enable me to tackle complex data challenges with confidence. ðŸ’ª
